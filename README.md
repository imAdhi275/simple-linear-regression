Simple Linear Regression
This project demonstrates how to predict house prices based on their size (in square feet) using Simple Linear Regression. The implementation is done using Python and the Scikit-learn library.
Dataset
The dataset consists of house sizes (in square feet) and their respective prices (in USD):

House Size (sq ft)	Price (USD)
800	150,000
1,000	180,000
1,200	200,000
1,500	250,000
1,800	300,000

Installation
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Output
yaml

1                1000      180000
2                1200      200000
3                1500      250000
4                1800      300000

Predicted price for a 1300 sq ft house: â‚¹16457340.00
